# OMNImenu / OmniMenu

Mod Menu for older versions of Geometry Dash (pre-1.9).

Currently being tested on version 1.22.

To compile: Run build script (TODO instructions for Windows)

After compiling the libmenu.so, put it in lib/armeabi. You must edit smali so it includes the menu library. You must also copy the resources from the resources folder of this project to the assets folder of the APK, otherwise the game will crash.
